# 🛡️ Phishing Email Analysis Project

Hi! This is a small project where I analyzed a suspicious email to identify phishing indicators. The goal is to understand how phishing works and what signs to look out for.

---

## 🧪 What This Project Is About

I received (or simulated) a suspicious email that claimed to be from Microsoft. I went through it step-by-step to check for signs that it could be fake or dangerous.

---

## ✅ Steps I Followed

### 1. Check the Sender's Email
- The email came from: `security@microsoftsupport.com`
- That domain looks official but it's not really from Microsoft!
- ⚠️ Microsoft usually sends emails from `@microsoft.com` or similar.

---

### 2. Look at the Email Headers
- I used an **email header analyzer** (like [MxToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx))
- I looked for SPF and DKIM entries, but:
  - ❌ No SPF = not verified
  - ❌ No DKIM = might be spoofed
- This tells me the email might be **fake**.

---

### 3. Spot Suspicious Links or Attachments
- The email had a button: `Review recent activity`
- But the real link was: `http://secure-microsoft-verify-login.com`
- 🚨 Not a real Microsoft domain!

---

### 4. Urgent or Scary Language
- It said: *"We detected something unusual..."*
- And: *"Secure your account immediately!"*
- 🧠 This is a trick to scare users into clicking.

---

### 5. Hover Over Links
- Always hover over links!
- What it *says* and where it actually *goes* might be different.
- ✅ That's what happened in this case.

---

### 6. Look for Spelling/Grammar Issues
- No obvious typos here, but:
  - No username
  - Very generic message
- That’s suspicious because real services usually personalize emails.
